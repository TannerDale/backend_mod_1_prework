## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?
  *It shows that learning is a skill that can be practiced like any other skill, which I didn't really think before.
  *I view learning as a process, not just something that happens. I always have a growth mindset as well. I enjoy getting better and improving at
     things I already know, and learning new things. I try to learn all I can.
  *I want to start reading more. I want to practice setting aside time to relax and read.
  *I would like to add practicing what you've learned in projects that interest you. It helps solidify the concepts you read/learned.

1. How would you print the string `"Hello World!"` to the terminal?

```

1. How would you print the string `"zebra"` using the variable that you created above?
```Ruby

1. What is interpolation? Use interpolation to print a sentence using the variable `animal`.
  *Inserting a variable into a string, transforms variable type into string prior to insertion
```ruby
  p "Marty the #{animal} got lost in the jungle."
```
1. What method is used to get input from a user?
  *gets.chomp, or gets.chomp.to_i if you need to get a number and do math on it

1. Name and describe two common string methods:
  *.length: returns the quantity of characters within the string.
  *.gsub: replace passed letters in a string for something else, or removing them entirely.

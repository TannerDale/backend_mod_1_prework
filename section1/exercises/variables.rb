# In the below exercises, write code that achieves
# the desired result. To check your work, run this
# file by entering the following command in your terminal:
# `ruby section1/exercises/variables.rb`

# Example: Write code that saves your name to a variable and
# prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
name = "Harry Potter"
p name

# Write code that saves the string 'Dobby' to a variable and
# prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
house_elf = "Dobby"
p house_elf

# Write code that saves the string 'Harry Potter must not return to Hogwarts!'
# and prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
does_not_belong = "harry Potter does not beong in Hogwarts!"
p does_not_belong
# Write code that adds 2 to the `students` variable and
# prints the result:
students = 22
students += 2
p students

# Write code that subracts 2 from the `students` variable and
# prints the result:
students -= 2
p students


# YOU DO:
# Declare three variables, named `first_name`, `is_hungry` and `number_of_pets`.
# Store the appropriate data types in each.
# print all three variables to the terminal.
first_name = "Tanner"
is_hungry = true
number_of_pets = 0
p first_name, is_hungry, number_of_pets

# IN WORDS:
# How did you decide to use the data type you did for each of the three variables above?
# Explain.

# For first_name: a name is a word, so it's be a string.
# For is_hungry: beeing hungry is either true or not true, so it's be a boolean.
# For number_of_pets: quantaties are numbers, and since
  # you can't have half a pet, no matter how small it is, it won't be a float, so
  # it's an integer.


# YOU DO:
# Re-assign the values to the three variables from the previous challenge to different values (but same data type).
# print all three variables to the terminal.
first_name = "Jimothy"
is_hungry = true
number_of_pets = 42
p first_name, is_hungry, number_of_pets


# YOU DO:
# Using the variables below, print the total number of snacks to the terminal:
healthy_snacks = 6;
junk_food_snacks = 8
p healthy_snacks + junk_food_snacks

# FINAL CHECK
#-------------------

# Did you run this file in your terminal to make sure everything printed out to the terminal
  # as you would expect?
